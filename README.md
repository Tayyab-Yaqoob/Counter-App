# Counter-App
This web application is a simple counter built using React. The counter allows users to increment and decrement a numerical value. However, the counter has constraints to ensure usability:<br><br>

<li>Minimum Value: The counter cannot be decremented below zero.</li>
<li> Maximum Value: The counter cannot be incremented above twenty.</li><br>
These constraints are in place to prevent the counter from going into negative numbers or excessively high values, maintaining a practical range for usage.
